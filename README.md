## 📖 About

Thirukkural is an ancient Tamil text composed by the legendary Tamil poet and philosopher **Thiruvalluvar**. It consists of 1,330 couplets (kurals) organized into 133 chapters, covering ethics, politics, economics, and love.

This application uses **AI-powered semantic search** to find the most contextually relevant Thirukkural for any given text or article, bridging ancient wisdom with modern technology.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Text Analysis**: Paste any text to find matching Thirukkural
- 🌐 **URL Analysis**: Submit article URLs for automatic content extraction and analysis
- 🤖 **Local AI**: Uses `sentence-transformers` for embeddings (no API keys required)
- 🎯 **Semantic Search**: Finds kurals based on meaning, not just keywords
- 🌍 **Bilingual Display**: Shows Tamil text with English translation and explanation
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient**: Pre-computed embeddings for instant results
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Simple, responsive interface built with vanilla HTML/CSS

## 🚀 Demo

### Text Mode
Simply paste your text and get the most relevant Thirukkural:

```
Input: "Friendship is important for a happy life"
Output: Kural about the value of friendship
```

### URL Mode
Submit any article URL and the app will extract and analyze it:

```
Input: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology
Output: Relevant Thirukkural based on the article's theme
```
